                <Text text="You cannot use it as an instant print camera without Snap compatible ZINK Photo Paper, and it does not come with so much as a single piece of ZINK (zero ink) paper, so you should order some when you order a Snap."/>

                <Text text="For someone who is in the market for a fun, retro, instant print camera with nostalgia and novelty value that they can take to parties, etc., the Snap is cool enough that despite the fact that you have to buy a pack of ZINK pape in order to use it as it's meant to be used, I can easily rate it 5 stars."/>

            <Sentence id="986:6">
                <Text text="The print quality itself adds to the nostalgia, in that the print quality is apparently designed and intended to be reminiscent of original Polaroid prints.The Snap has no built-in memory, but it does have a slot for a microSD card."/>

            <Sentence id="986:7">
                <Text text="Technically, if you put a microSD card in a Snap, you can use the Snap without ZINK paper, and you can access the images by putting the microSD card into another device or by connecting the Snap to a computer with the included USB cable (which is also the charging cable)."/>

            <Sentence id="986:8">
                <Text text="But based on my experience, I'd say there'd be no point in using a microSD card in the Snap unless you are also using ZINK paper."/>

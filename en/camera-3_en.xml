                <Text text="this was more then I even expected, the look reminds me of vintage Polaroid, the display screen on the back is very large which is awesome to review photos before you print them, I also love you can insert a ad card in to print out other photos not just ones you've taken with this camera, the photos are easy to load just open and place in, they print out very fast and the quality is good, give them a few moments to dry so they don't smuge, the camera is light weight but would be easier to hold with a carrying case, I enjoy this camera very much, I did get a discount for review but I never let their effect my opinion either way."/>

                <Text text="I do think that the camera quality can be better, but instant cameras in general usually don't have good photo qualities anyways as far as I know (you would be getting DSLR cameras if you want to take high-quality photos--instant cameras serve a different purpose of capturing memories in a reminiscent old fashioned way), and if you think of this as a photo printer with instant camera added, I think it is a better deal to get this instead of getting a photo printer."/>

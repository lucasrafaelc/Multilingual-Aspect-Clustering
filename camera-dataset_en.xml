                <Text text="this was more then I even expected, the look reminds me of vintage Polaroid, the display screen on the back is very large which is awesome to review photos before you print them, I also love you can insert a ad card in to print out other photos not just ones you've taken with this camera, the photos are easy to load just open and place in, they print out very fast and the quality is good, give them a few moments to dry so they don't smuge, the camera is light weight but would be easier to hold with a carrying case, I enjoy this camera very much, I did get a discount for review but I never let their effect my opinion either way." />
